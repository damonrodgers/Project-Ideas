Dementia Home Care (ios app)
----------------------

### Overview

Living with dementia can have a big emotional, social, psychological and practical impact on a person, their families and their carers.

The way a person with dementia feels and experiences life is down to more than just having the condition. There are many other factors aside from the symptoms of dementia that play a huge role in shaping someone's experience. These include the relationships the person has, their environment and the support they receive.

Carers, friends and family, can help a person with dementia to feel valued and included. Support should be sensitive to the person as an individual, and focus on promoting their wellbeing and meeting their needs. This innovative app will enable the carers to keep track of various aspects of the patients character, their activies, provide a dementia date and time clock, along with facilities to track their medication, eating and drink habits. 

This app will replace alot of paper based recording, ensuring everything is in one place and carers of the patient can ensure that the recording will not be lost or misplaced. This can also be viewed by family members of the patient at their own home if needs be.

I do not plan on building this app but more focusing upon the UX and UI aspect behind it, along with designing various interactive physical activities for the patient to carry out by themselves, with a carer or relative.

### Pros

+ I worked over summer with dementia patients in a care home under the employer  Age NI, so finding research and users to interview will be of ease. 

+ My Mum manages a care home for elderly people, therefore any additional research can be easily obtained from doctors of carers if needed.

+ Carers will have to spend less time recording and be able to spend more quality time with the patient. More human interaction!


### Cons

+ A lot of research will be needed to understand the process of the carer and patient, I never have experienced home help.

+ The users will be required to have an ipad, as the app will be designed for an ipad intially. 

+ As the app will be designed for an ipad, other devices such as samsung will not be able to download the app.


### How might it be built?

I will use sketch along with invision to create an interactive prototype of the app, how it work and the functionality of it. I am not overly confident using sketch, but I think now is the perfect time to push myself and learn how to use it to its full capacity. 

I want to use illustrator for the likes of illustrative icons and creating dementia based activities, such as an illustration turned into a jigsaw or a matching activity for people with advanced dementia. 

### Who’s it for?

The target market for this project:

1. People who have been diagnosed with dementia
2. Carers of people with the condition

Evidently, when designing this app I need to consider both parties, as the app needs to be easily used for every age of carer. 

Aspects of the app such as the physical activities and the dementia date and time clock will have to be specically designed for people with dementia.

### What’s the business model?

 Evidently this will be under a health care app, therefore the nhs will provide funding for the building and up keep of this website.
 
 It will be available to all carers who care for people with dementia in their own homes, to promote independent living and reducing stress on the health care professionals as all records will be available at the click of a button.
