Dementia Home Care (App)
----------------------

### Overview

Living with dementia can have a big emotional, social, psychological and practical impact on a person, their families and their carers.

The way a person with dementia feels and experiences life is down to more than just having the condition. There are many other factors aside from the symptoms of dementia that play a huge role in shaping someone's experience. These include the relationships the person has, their environment and the support they receive.

Carers, friends and family, can help a person with dementia to feel valued and included. Support should be sensitive to the person as an individual, and focus on promoting their wellbeing and meeting their needs. This innovative app will enable the carers to keep track of various aspects of the patients character, their activies, provide a dementia date and time clock, along with facilities to track their medication, eating and drink habits. 

This app will replace alot of paper based recording, ensuring everything is in one place and carers of the patient can ensure that the recording will not be lost or misplaced. This can also be viewed by family members of the patient at their own home if needs be.

I do not plan on building this app but more focusing upon the UX and UI aspect behind it, along with designing various interactive physical activities for the patient to carry out by themselves, with a carer or relative.

### Pros

+ I worked over summer with dementia patients in a care home under the employer  Age NI, so finding research and users to interview will be of ease. 

+ My Mum manages a care home for elderly people, therefore any additional research can be easily obtained from doctors of carers if needed.

+ Carers will have to spend less time recording and be able to spend more quality time with the patient. More human interaction!


### Cons

+ A lot of research will be needed to understand the process of the carer and patient, I never have experienced home help.

+ The users will be required to have an ipad, as the app will be designed for an ipad intially. 

+ As the app will be designed for an ipad, other devices such as samsung will not be able to download the app.


### How might it be built?

I will use sketch along with invision to create an interactive prototype of the app, how it work and the functionality of it. I am not overly confident using sketch, but I think now is the perfect time to push myself and learn how to use it to its full capacity. 

I want to use illustrator for the likes of illustrative icons and creating dementia based activities, such as an illustration turned into a jigsaw or a matching activity for people with advanced dementia. 

### Who’s it for?

The target market for this project:

1. People who have been diagnosed with dementia
2. Carers of people with the condition

Evidently, when designing this app I need to consider both parties, as the app needs to be easily used for every age of carer. 

Aspects of the app such as the physical activities and the dementia date and time clock will have to be specically designed for people with dementia.

### What’s the business model?

 Evidently this will be under a health care app, therefore the nhs will provide funding for the building and up keep of this website.
 
 It will be available to all carers who care for people with dementia in their own homes, to promote independent living and reducing stress on the health care professionals as all records will be available at the click of a button.

The University Cookbook (Website)
----------------------------------

### Overview

Going to University can be tough in many ways, without getting everything handed to you on a plate (literally). Although many people can cook substantial meals for themselves, there are still many who can't. But not anymore!

One thing I found hard was buying food that would last for the whole week, planning ahead with meals and making sure I was shopping on a budget. I didn't really think about spending money, just as and when.

The idea for this would be a website, with various different thing that students can cook at a cheap budget, giving them details of nearby grocery outlets with the cheapest ingredients. This web site will be built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with a built in database to hold key ingredients, pricing and names of stores.

As a website is pretty basic, I would like to consider other methods to use such as apps for both ios and android taken into consideration as after all, majority of students access everything on their phone or tablets. 

### Pros

+ I have a good knowdledge of HTML and CSS and this will also give me an opportunity to broaden my skills using javascript. 

+ Students will now have more money due to the budgeting that they can now do on the website. 

+ Students will (hopefully) become more healthier and have better eating habits, as food recipes will be easy for them to recreate and instructions will be detailed. 


### Cons

+ I’ve never incorporated a database into a website before, this could be a challenge.

+ All the recepies have to be researched, along with ingredients and what store has the cheapest product. This will be extremely time consuming.

+ Will students really care for what they eat?

+ More money saved, more money spent on alcohol...

### How might it be built?

I think the initial idea will be served via a website. I plan on building it using HTML, CSS and Javascript. For the database that will be attached, this is a concern of mine as I have no experience with an underlying database. However, this year I want to take the opportunity to learn anything and everything that I can! 

I also would like to incorporate alot of new CSS techniques into the building of this new website as it will make it more eye catching and appealing to the audience it is aimed at, and also will enabled me to stay up to date with my knowledge and understanding of the code. 


### Who’s it for?

Evidently, the Virtual Cookbook will be aimed specifically at University Students that are living away from home and have to cook for themselves. However, anyone can use the website if they want a handy and easy way to create a meal for themselves! There isn't an age limit. 


### What’s the business model?

I don't think it is nesseccary to have a business model for this idea. Already students have enough to pay for such as accomodation and fees, therefore the last thing they will want to pay for is a recipe website. This will cost them more money which they are saving my researching the cheapest pricing, doesn't make sense.

Teaching kids about mental illnesses (App)
----------------------------------

### Overview

One in four people in the world will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives. Around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill-health and disability worldwide.

These are drastically high numbers, and they are on the rise. As Children are innocent and oblivious to many of these issues, I think some sort of an app to inform and teach them in a more simplified way would be a great idea. We all know, or will know, someone who has suffered or is currently suffering with a mental health issue.

The overall Idea will be an informative app, with illustrations of characters that represent different types of mental health problems. This way, the children will be able to associate the character with a feeling. I will also include some animations or videos to inform the child with a voice over.

I will also include some interactive activities for the kids perhaps to test there knowledge and understanding of the different types of mental health issues, making it more engaging and fun for them! I yet again will not be coding the actual app, but more focusing upon the illustrative, UI and UX aspect of the app. 

### Pros

+ I have a good knowledge of designing for UI and UX after my placement year.

+ Kids will become more understanding of mental health issues, this will help them understand if they know of anyone suffering from the issues included in the app who are close to them.

+ This app could also help the child become more aware of their own mental health, and be able to talk openly of the issues if anything begins to bother them.

+ I have nieces and nephews, therefore research will become easy to obtain. My mum is also a retired mental health nurse so gaining information about the issues will also be of ease.


### Cons

+ People may argue that children do not need to know about mental health issues at such a young age. 

+ Showing children topics and videos about mental health might encourage them to pathologise their emotions.

+ Mental health is a complicated topic. Adults still can't determine sometimes wether they are said or really said and expecting children to do this will also be a challenge. They may confuse feeling generally sad is depression.

+ I have never used any form of animation software, this will be a major challenge. However, I am willing to learn. 

### How might it be built?

I will use sketch along with invision to create an interactive prototype of the app, how it work and the functionality of it. I am not overly confident using sketch, but I think now is the perfect time to push myself and learn how to use it to its full capacity. 

I want to use illustrator for the illustrative characters that I want to create to represent all the different mental health issues. I will use After Effects to create animated versions of the characters to show how emotions and feelings can change. 

### Who’s it for?

The target market for this project will be of children from the age 6-12. I think around 6 years of age will be a good age to inform them about the issues that can arise within their own mind or people that they know. However, I think from around 13 years the illustrative aspect will become abit childish, therefore they would need a more mature design.

### What’s the business model?

This will be a free to use app, as charging fee would put people off and therefore people will not use it. I think this could potentially be used within schools to educate children so this is something that I could look into upon researching into this idea further.
